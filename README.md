## About

Nudge is a 2D game library meant to be a template for my own
future game projects. I wanted the framework (Nudge),
and it's development to be publicly available for anyone interested in building
a Game / Game Engine from scratch in Java (Hence the name). Feel free to browse and / or
use any part of the framework.

The Nudge framework intends to be completed and Its development will end in some final state.
It will support some predefined core features, and hopefully support them well. I.e. Keeping it simple!


While Nudge can be used as a template for 2D games in general, it is designed with some specific
use-cases in mind:

* Top down
* Low resolution
* Lots of entities
* Calculation heavy
* Procedural content

Think RTS or Simulation games! 

## API Overview

Broad overview of the intended scope of the framework. Further details and documentation will be included
somewhere along the line of development! 

<span style="color:lightgreen">Intended API</span>

* OpenGL capable graphics driver
* Java 1.8


### Built With

#### [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/)
Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics

#### [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
Widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics API

#### [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.



#### [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
Image loading library with support for multiple image formats and color channels


#### [JOML](https://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/)
A Java math library for OpenGL rendering calculations
