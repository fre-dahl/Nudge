## Features

Modern [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) through the [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/) library for fast GPU rendering.

* [2D graphics]() ([OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/))
* [GameState management]()
* [Entity component system]()

* [Window and Input]() ([GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/))
* [Serialization and networking]()
* [SteamWorks API integration]()

## About

Nudge is a 2D game library meant to be a template for my own
future game projects. I wanted the framework (Nudge),
and it's development to be publicly available for anyone interested in building
a Game / Game Engine from scratch in Java (Hence the name). Feel free to browse and / or
use any part of the framework.

The Nudge project intends to be completed and Its development will end in some final state.
It will support some predefined core features and hopefully support them well!


While Nudge can be used as a template for 2D games in general, it is designed with some specific
use-cases in mind:

* Top down
* Low resolution
* Lots of entities
* Calculation heavy
* Procedural content

Think RTS or Simulation games!


Intended Support:



####2D graphics

  * Orthographic camera
    * Easy to set up
    * culling
  * General sprite batching
  * Particles
    * Instanced rendering
    * Pools
  * Default Shaders
    * Sprites
    * Tile maps
    * UI / Text
    * Normal-mapping
    * Water
    * Lighting
  * Bitmap font rendering
  * Texture packing (atlas)
  * Animation
    * States
  
####Lightweight physics system

  * Collision handling
    * Soft (Push pull "springs")
    * Hard (AABB)
    * QuadTree
  
####Entity Component System

####Game State Management

####Serialization and Networking

  * Represent anything as compact binary
  * UDP network transmission protocol
  * Multi-threaded networking
  * Client / Server
  

####SteamWorks API integration

####Tile maps

  * Runtime procedural generation
  * Low memory footprint
  * Auto-tiling (8-Bit bit-masking)

Nudge will not support:

* Networking security protocols


While Nudge can be used as template for 2D games in general, it is designed with some specific
game genres / concepts in mind. Low resolution, CPU demanding, Top down, RTS, Rogue-like, procedural generation.
